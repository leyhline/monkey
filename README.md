# Monkey Programming Language

This is an interpreter for the [Monkey Programming Language](https://monkeylang.org/), based on the books from [Thorsten Ball](https://thorstenball.com/).

This is essentially the same implementation as presented in the books. I didn't change much from the initial implementation apart from some refactorings. It's more about getting some practical experience with Go and Interpreter terminology.
